# The spectral projection of `S*S` and the lower-bound subspace

*Why this file is needed:* it is the capstone of the `BasicResults.Spectral` subpackage — the
single spectral-theory input that the `s`-number uniqueness theorem consumes for **arbitrary
bounded** operators. It assembles the per-field constructions into one uniform statement and
derives the geometric fact the factorisation needs.

## What it provides

* `SpectralRepresentation.exists_spectral_projection` — for **every** `RCLike` field `𝕜` and a
  bounded `S : H₁ →L[𝕜] H₂`, the spectral projection `E = E_{[c²,∞)}(S*S)` with its two
  operator-norm bounds:
  * `c · ‖E x‖ ≤ ‖S (E x)‖` (on `ran E`, `S` is bounded below by `c`);
  * `‖S ∘ (1 - E)‖ ≤ c` (on the complement, `S` is bounded above by `c`).

  It is proved **uniformly over `RCLike`** by realification: view `H₁, H₂` as real Hilbert spaces,
  apply the real spectral projection (`exists_spectral_projection_real`, itself built by
  complexification), and lift the result back to a `𝕜`-linear operator — it *is* `𝕜`-linear
  because it commutes with scalar multiplication. This avoids any case split on `𝕜 = ℝ`/`ℂ` (which
  Lean cannot do) and any spectral hypothesis on downstream theorems.

* `SpectralRepresentation.exists_lowerBound_subspace` — **(★)**: for `0 ≤ c < aₙ(S)` there is an
  `(n+1)`-dimensional subspace `M ⊆ H₁` with `‖S x‖ ≥ c ‖x‖` on `M`. The range of `E` has dimension
  `≥ n+1` (else `S∘E` is rank `≤ n` with `‖S - S∘E‖ ≤ c`, contradicting `aₙ(S) > c`), and `S` is
  bounded below by `c` there. This is the geometric heart of `SVD.exists_scalar_factorisation`.

/-- **Spectral projection of `S*S`, uniformly over any `RCLike` field.** Realify `H₁, H₂` to real
Hilbert spaces, take the real spectral projection, and lift it back to a `𝕜`-linear operator: the
lift is `𝕜`-linear because it commutes with scalar multiplication (the commutation conjunct of
`exists_spectral_projection_real`). The key sublemma `adjoint (S.restrictScalars ℝ) =
(adjoint S).restrictScalars ℝ` is proved inline. -/
