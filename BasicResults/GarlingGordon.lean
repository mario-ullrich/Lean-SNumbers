# The Garling–Gordon projection theorem

A closed subspace of a Banach space whose codimension is at most `n` is the
kernel of a bounded projection of norm at most `√n + ε`, for every `ε > 0`. This
is a classical fact of Banach-space geometry (Garling–Gordon 1971; Pietsch,
*Eigenvalues and s-numbers* 1.7.17). It is the *dual* of Kadets–Snobar
(`BasicResults.KadetsSnobar`).

The theorem is reduced to the John's-ellipsoid development in `BasicResults.John`:
`John.exists_projection_ker` supplies, for each `ε > 0`, a projection with kernel
`M` and `‖P‖ ≤ √(codim M) + ε`, and we weaken `codim M` to `n`. The result is
fully proved: `John.john_decomposition` (the John decomposition of identity) is
established in `BasicResults.John`. The `ε` is intrinsic to the general Banach setting
(the quotient norm is an infimum that need not be attained); the applications in
`SNumbers.Inequalities` recover the sharp constant by letting `ε → 0`.
